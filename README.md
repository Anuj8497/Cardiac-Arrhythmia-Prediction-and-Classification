# Cardiac-Arrhythmia-Prediction-and-Classification-using-Python
In this project, my teammates and I designed a deep learning model that takes inpatient records and determines whether a patient suffers from cardiac arrhythmia or not. 
The model also classifies the patient records into various classes. The multiple classifications being the type of arrhythmia. 
Over the timeline of the project, we tried implementing various machine learning algorithms. But in the end, we settled on neural networks. 
In neural networks, we tried and tested our model with various activation functions like sigmoid, softmax, ReLU, and leaky ReLU. 
We were able to achieve an accuracy of ~70%.
Room for improvement does exist as we never implemented SVM.

The dataset and the information regarding it is present in the data folder.
