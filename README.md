# Cardiac-Arrhythmia-Prediction-and-Classification-using-Python
In this project, I've designed a deep learning model which takes in patient records and determines whether patient suffers from 
cardiac arrhythmia or not. 
The model also classifies the patient records into various classes. The various classes being the type of arrhythmia the patient might suffer from.
